# FruitClustering

This project aims to cluster different fruits based on their characteristics using Python and relevant data analysis libraries. The dataset contains observations of three distinct types of fruits, and our objective is to group them based on their inherent traits.

## Project Objectives

- Explore and describe the dataset using standard descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques.
- Preprocess the data, handling any missing values or outliers as necessary.
- Apply at least two different clustering algorithms to the dataset.
- Determine the most optimal number of clusters for our analysis.
- Evaluate and compare the accuracy of the clustering models.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:

- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)

You can install these libraries using pip:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:

git clone https://github.com/AriolaLeka/FruitClustering.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd FruitClustering/Fruits.ipynd

## Collaboration

This project was done in collaboration with my colleague Francisco Amoros Cubells.
